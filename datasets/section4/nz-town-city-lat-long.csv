As Wellington had been named in honour of Britain’s most famous soldier, the New Zealand Company felt it was fitting to call the settlement across the strait by the name of her most famous sailor, naming it for Vice-Admiral The Viscount Horatio Nelson. Many original street names follow a 'Nelson' theme, eg 'Trafalgar', 'Nile', 'St. Vincent' after battles, 'Hardy' and 'Collingwood' after admirals, 'Vanguard' and 'Victory' after ships of the line. In its early history Nelson was jocularly known as Hobson’s Choice; see Hobsonville.

Maori names for the village on the site of the settlement: Wakatu, lit. waka: canoe; tu: to pile up; i.e. A place where broken canoes were deposited, but also rendered sheltered harbour; or Whakatu, lit. to erect or raise up, or a formal speech. The Boulder Bank was Te Tahuna-a-Tamaiea, lit. te: the; tahuna: shoal; a: of; Tamaiea (also spelt Te Maia). Tamaiea created the bank that enabled Nelson to provide safe anchor for waka.

A Ngāti Koata version of the naming relates it to a person who sought refuge here and was told ‘Whakaturia tou pa ki a tena puke’ which means ‘Set up your home on that hill’. The area became known as Whakaturia and later Whakatu. Refer Wakatu (suburb).

The name comes from the high bluff that dominates the town and the harbour, although the name was not officially recognised until 1917. It was known to the early whalers as Old Man Bluff, or Old Man’s Bluff; it is shown as ‘Old Man’s Bluff Point’ on a chart created by Captain W.L. Edwardson in 1822. In his book Bluff Harbour, Dr John Hall-Jones wrote: ‘Another early name for Bluff was Cape Bernadin. This name was given by Lieutenant Thomas McDonnell, R.N., who produced an extraordinary map of New Zealand in the 1830s . . . The name comes from San Bernadino in the Philippines, where McDonnell’s son was born.’ For many years it was known as Port Macquarie after Lachlan Macquarie, an early governor of New South Wales. When the township was surveyed it became Campbelltown after the maiden name of the wife of Colonel Sir Thomas Gore Browne, governor of New Zealand. See also Bluff Harbour. Maori name: Tikore. It cannot be translated literally with any pretence to accuracy, and may well have been named after a Maori chief. Tikore is rendered Te Kuri, lit. te: the; kuri: dog, by Dr John Hall Jones. A name for Bluff peninsula was Motupohue, which Hall-Jones translates as Island of convolvulus (pohue or Calystegia sepium). It is now officially The Bluff/Matupöhue following the Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998. The spelling may be Motupoua and related to a hill known as ‘knoll of the old man’, after a Ngati Mamoe chief who was buried here in about 1650 overlooking his domain. Place Names of the Ancestors also records that Tamateapokai-whenua (or Tamatea-ure haea) gave a name for Bluff Hill: Te Karehu-a-Tamatea, lit. the oven of Tamatea.'
